								<p>For Unit 2 (Managing a Music Product), Conrad, Owen, and I are all working on producing a virtual music concert. We are currently in the early stages of planning as we generate set list ideas and go over other information and challenges.<br><br>Upon beginning work, a slight limitation becomes apparent: we have two drummers (Owen and Conrad) and a pianist/keyboardist (myself). That doesn’t really make for a particularly varied ensemble, does it? We’ll most likely cover and compose songs individually (while still communicating with each other, of course) and then have 3-6 performances to piece together.<br><br>I have some significant video editing and technical experience, so I’m primarily focusing on those areas while Conrad and Owen are focusing more on the content of the concert.<br><br><b>In Lesson</b><br>We have achieved the following in lesson today:<br>Assigned roles<br>Generated a long list of performance ideas<br>Determined the release platform<br>Listed some of the instruments we may need to use<br>Listed the hardware and software we may need to use<br>Completed a brief search into the legal side (copyright, etc.)<br><br><b>At Home</b><br>At home we have all added additional songs to the list and will remove any songs that we know we won’t use.</p>

								<p>We have made more progress today by starting to confirm some of the songs we’ll be performing in the virtual concert. To make it fair, each member of the group selected 1 song that they definitely wanted all of us to work on collaboratively. We have also started adding solo performances, too. If there’s a particular song we want to do ourselves and we have enough time to practice, record, and edit it, we can add it to the list.</p>
								<p><b>As of right now, the following are confirmed (though more may be added and the order is subject to change):</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Coldplay – Trouble in Town</li>
									<li>Woodkid – Run Boy Run</li>
									<li>Blur – Girls and Boy</li>
									<li>Foster the People – Pumped Up Kicks</li>
									<li>Blur – Song 2</li>
									<li>Arctic Monkeys – I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor</li>
								</ul>
								<p>With the songs alone, those six should take our minimum runtime to around 22 minutes. The actual length will be longer when intros and outros as well as potential additional songs are accounted for. I still need to decide on a solo piece, for example.</p>
								<p>As for time management and organisation, we are trialling the idea of using a Gantt chart for tracking tasks and categories of work.</p>
								<p>We are yet to determine the deadline and title of the virtual concert, but this will be decided upon in the coming days. Our main method of communication for planning has been a WhatsApp group, and I’ll go ahead and compile decisions and suggestions sent there as well just for documentation.</p>

								<p>We had our first official meeting for our virtual concert project today. It was hosted using Google Meet and took place on 11 September at 19:00. Here are the key takeaways:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Three group performances are confirmed and we’ll begin to make progress on primarily “Run Boy Run” shortly alongside the others</li>
									<li>The concert theme (thus determining the target audience) will be rock and indie music between 2000 and 2020.</li>
									<li>The name hasn’t been decided but we’ll confirm this over the coming days on WhatsApp.</li>
									<li>We’ll be creating an Instagram account for our music endeavours (including this concert) for added publicity and promotion.</li>
									<li>Our deadline has been set at December 2020. We believe that completing and delivering the virtual concert in this timeframe is achievable.</li>
									<li>While we can’t practice in real life, this shouldn’t prove to be too much of an issue as the product will be virtual like much of our progress and evidencing.</li>
									<li>I will be responsible for design, audio, and video editing for the concert. Conrad will be the main cinematographer.</li>
									<li>We’re aiming for our concert’s runtime to be at 25-30 minutes.</li>
									<li>The next meeting has not been scheduled, and the date and time will be determined on the amount of progress we make and when we feel we’re ready to come back and discuss further topics.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>A video of the meeting is attached below, though due to a technical issue, other participants could not be heard. As a result, sections where the automated captions didn’t pick up on speech have been cut and this issue will be rectified for the next meeting.</p>
							<p>We’ll begin putting our plans into action over the coming days.</p>

								<p>We held our second meeting today to run over a couple of topics again.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Merchandising could be an option. Was primarily for the group to wear, but it could become publicly available. Pattern paper and ironing or online services can be used.</li>
									<li>The minimum runtime with our currently confirmed songs will be recalculated. Should be around 30 minutes on just songs.</li>
									<li>We know what we need to do with the current songs we have confirmed, and we spoke about other songs to consider.</li>
									<li>The Instagram account, which Conrad is responsible for, has 24 followers already. It has been set up as a Creator account to enable access to insights.</li>

								<p>This week we have been tasked with creating a questionnaire to distribute between and gather information from our target audience. We will be using Google Forms because it integrates directly with our school accounts which we use to host all of our files on Google Drive.</p>
								<p>We will be collecting the following information:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Age Range</li>
									<li>Rock & indie songs listened to</li>
									<li>Favourite rock & indie songs</li>
									<li>All music genres listened to</li>
									<li>Interest in collaborating with other students</li>
									<li>Preferred concert length</li>
									<li>Interest in live event participation, etc.</li>
									<li>Interest in behind-the-scenes clips</li>
									<li>Social media platforms</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We hope to be able to further cater for our target audience by using the data provided from questionnaire responses. The group will be taking an extensive look at the feedback we’ve received in our next meeting.</p>

								<p>Today we held another meeting having just closed responses to our audience questionnaire. Our key findings are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>41 responses were received, with the vast majority falling between the ages 13-16. This is our target demographic.</li>
									<li>Coldplay was the most recognised artist, along with their song “Paradise”. They were followed by Imagine Dragons and Arctic Monkeys. It would be good to include songs from these top three artists.</li>
									<li>A multitude of bands and artists in the indie & rock genres were suggested. We’ll be listening to some of the tracks, however, some of them are too guitar-heavy to include (only so much can be reproduced by us in a digital audio workstation).</li>
									<li>The average preferred concert length was 35 minutes.</li>
									<li>85% of respondents were interested in watching the concert live if possible, 95% also wanted to see behind-the-scenes and extra content.</li>
									<li>YouTube, followed by Instagram, is the most popular social media platform. We will be publish the concert on YouTube, alongside sneak peeks and other updates on Instagram.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We will use this data to ensure our concert appeals to as much of our target demographic as possible.</p>

								<p>Another meeting was held today to discuss marketing and promotional material for the ’25 Years of Rock & Indie’ concert.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A website is being worked on by myself.</li>
									<li>Conrad is investigating possibilities of merchandising, it would also be good for promotion.</li>
									<li>Owen is looking at how posters and a radio advertisement could be integrated into our promotional and marketing strategies.</li>
									<li>Conrad is still running the Instagram account, which sits on 60 followers as of the meeting.</li>
									<li>The success criteria is being worked on in conjunction with the Gantt chart / timeline. We will also be working on researching other promotional strategies and press releases.</li>

								<p>Following on from our previous meeting, I have produced a new document that details marketing and promotional strategies and platforms. The document details how we can best utilise social media, websites, posters, merchandising, and radio adverts to help with promoting our product, ’25 Years of Rock & Indie’.</p>

								<p>School closures have come into effect once again, so we’ve decided to hold another meeting to discuss the progress we’ve made so far and how we can mitigate the challenges that lockdown poses.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The majority of the promotional tasks discussed at our previous meeting have been completed. We still need to work on a radio advert, but the Instagram account sits at 76 followers and we will continue to post more behind-the-scenes content from home.</li>
									<li>We already have the equipment necessary to continue practising. This means we can keep on sending each other our work and we will try our best to document all practice.</li>
									<li>The deadline has been shifted to the end of the school year in July. We may not need to utilise much of the extra time, but it is appreciated as the lockdown will set us back a bit.</li>

								<p>We got the opportunity to come into school and practice in person today. It was great to see Conrad and Owen in person after schools have been shut again for a couple of months, and I think we got a lot from the session. Our work was solely focused on the performance aspect of our virtual concert.</p>
								<p>The main benefit from being able to play music together in person was getting the chance to piece together the separate parts we had each been practising. Trying to play in time with each other over video calls doesn’t work due to delays on all ends, syncing separate audio clips in post each time we go to practice together would be impractical. We were able to get some songs sounding really good; the informal audio recordings don’t do it justice.</p>
								<p>We were also able to share how we were getting on with our solo performances. For example, Owen’s performance of Song 2 by Blur is sounding great, and we’re near to the stage where we can properly record it. Speaking of Song 2, I’ve found some of the stems for the song, which is good because we can overlay the original guitar track (none of us really play guitar that well, if at all). Even when we were playing by ourselves, it was useful to have the others around to offer feedback.</p>
								<p>We’ll continue to practice our parts and hopefully we’ll be able to play together more often once schools eventually re-open.</p>
