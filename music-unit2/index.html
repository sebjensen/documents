								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>We have created a series of rock & indie performances to be published and shared on the Internet via YouTube.</li>
									<li>There are 2 main roles for this project, performance and editing/technical. I will be recording audio and editing the concert, and Owen and Conrad will be the prime performers. Conrad will also serve as the Head of Cinematography.</li>
									<li>The production process and product lifecycle covers planning and ideation, rehearsal, recording, editing, marketing and promotion, delivering and publishing, and the evaluation. Out first steps were to select and confirm the music we wanted to play, along with the theme and audience of the concert.</li>
									<li>Our target audience will be teenagers of secondary school age, who listen to and enjoy rock and indie/alternative music. They relate to us in age, music taste, but many of them will also be interested in performing music themselves.</li>
									<li>Teamwork and collaboration was seamless, alongside recording and editing, however, we experienced a few issues and changes pertaining to time management and release of the product.</li>
									<li>I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yN1P4c3LPgG3WCcVfqS0hX6irFiApChDm4O3ih8MHWs/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">timeline/gantt chart</a> to help with scheduling the production process.</li>

								<p>For Unit 2 (Managing a Music Product), Conrad, Owen, and I are all working on producing a virtual music concert. We are currently in the early stages of planning as we generate set list ideas and go over other information and challenges.<br><br>Upon beginning work, a slight limitation becomes apparent: we have two drummers (Owen and Conrad) and a pianist/keyboardist (myself). That doesn’t really make for a particularly varied ensemble, does it? We’ll most likely cover and compose songs individually (while still communicating with each other, of course) and then have 3-6 performances to piece together.<br><br>I have some significant video editing and technical experience, so I’m primarily focusing on those areas while Conrad and Owen are focusing more on the content of the concert.<br><br><b>In Lesson</b><br>We have achieved the following in lesson today:<br>Assigned roles<br>Generated a long list of performance ideas<br>Determined the release platform<br>Listed some of the instruments we may need to use<br>Listed the hardware and software we may need to use<br>Completed a brief search into the legal side (copyright, etc.)<br><br><b>At Home</b><br>At home we have all added additional songs to the list and will remove any songs that we know we won’t use.</p>

								<p>We have made more progress today by starting to confirm some of the songs we’ll be performing in the virtual concert. To make it fair, each member of the group selected 1 song that they definitely wanted all of us to work on collaboratively. We have also started adding solo performances, too. If there’s a particular song we want to do ourselves and we have enough time to practice, record, and edit it, we can add it to the list.</p>
								<p><b>As of right now, the following are confirmed (though more may be added and the order is subject to change):</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Coldplay – Trouble in Town</li>
									<li>Woodkid – Run Boy Run</li>
									<li>Blur – Girls and Boy</li>
									<li>Foster the People – Pumped Up Kicks</li>
									<li>Blur – Song 2</li>
									<li>Arctic Monkeys – I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor</li>
								</ul>
								<p>With the songs alone, those six should take our minimum runtime to around 22 minutes. The actual length will be longer when intros and outros as well as potential additional songs are accounted for. I still need to decide on a solo piece, for example.</p>
								<p>As for time management and organisation, we are trialling the idea of using a Gantt chart for tracking tasks and categories of work.</p>
								<p>We are yet to determine the deadline and title of the virtual concert, but this will be decided upon in the coming days. Our main method of communication for planning has been a WhatsApp group, and I’ll go ahead and compile decisions and suggestions sent there as well just for documentation.</p>

								<p>We had our first official meeting for our virtual concert project today. It was hosted using Google Meet and took place on 11 September at 19:00. Here are the key takeaways:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Three group performances are confirmed and we’ll begin to make progress on primarily “Run Boy Run” shortly alongside the others</li>
									<li>The concert theme (thus determining the target audience) will be rock and indie music between 2000 and 2020.</li>
									<li>The name hasn’t been decided but we’ll confirm this over the coming days on WhatsApp.</li>
									<li>We’ll be creating an Instagram account for our music endeavours (including this concert) for added publicity and promotion.</li>
									<li>Our deadline has been set at December 2020. We believe that completing and delivering the virtual concert in this timeframe is achievable.</li>
									<li>While we can’t practice in real life, this shouldn’t prove to be too much of an issue as the product will be virtual like much of our progress and evidencing.</li>
									<li>I will be responsible for design, audio, and video editing for the concert. Conrad will be the main cinematographer.</li>
									<li>We’re aiming for our concert’s runtime to be at 25-30 minutes.</li>
									<li>The next meeting has not been scheduled, and the date and time will be determined on the amount of progress we make and when we feel we’re ready to come back and discuss further topics.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>A video of the meeting is attached below, though due to a technical issue, other participants could not be heard. As a result, sections where the automated captions didn’t pick up on speech have been cut and this issue will be rectified for the next meeting.</p>
							<p>We’ll begin putting our plans into action over the coming days.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Merchandising could be an option. Was primarily for the group to wear, but it could become publicly available. Pattern paper and ironing or online services can be used.</li>
									<li>The minimum runtime with our currently confirmed songs will be recalculated. Should be around 30 minutes on just songs.</li>
									<li>We know what we need to do with the current songs we have confirmed, and we spoke about other songs to consider.</li>
									<li>The Instagram account, which Conrad is responsible for, has 24 followers already. It has been set up as a Creator account to enable access to insights.</li>

								<p>This week we have been tasked with creating a questionnaire to distribute between and gather information from our target audience. We will be using Google Forms because it integrates directly with our school accounts which we use to host all of our files on Google Drive.</p>
								<p>We will be collecting the following information:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Age Range</li>
									<li>Rock & indie songs listened to</li>
									<li>Favourite rock & indie songs</li>
									<li>All music genres listened to</li>
									<li>Interest in collaborating with other students</li>
									<li>Preferred concert length</li>
									<li>Interest in live event participation, etc.</li>
									<li>Interest in behind-the-scenes clips</li>
									<li>Social media platforms</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We hope to be able to further cater for our target audience by using the data provided from questionnaire responses. The group will be taking an extensive look at the feedback we’ve received in our next meeting.</p>

								<p>Today we held another meeting having just closed responses to our audience questionnaire. Our key findings are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>41 responses were received, with the vast majority falling between the ages 13-16. This is our target demographic.</li>
									<li>Coldplay was the most recognised artist, along with their song “Paradise”. They were followed by Imagine Dragons and Arctic Monkeys. It would be good to include songs from these top three artists.</li>
									<li>A multitude of bands and artists in the indie & rock genres were suggested. We’ll be listening to some of the tracks, however, some of them are too guitar-heavy to include (only so much can be reproduced by us in a digital audio workstation).</li>
									<li>The average preferred concert length was 35 minutes.</li>
									<li>85% of respondents were interested in watching the concert live if possible, 95% also wanted to see behind-the-scenes and extra content.</li>
									<li>YouTube, followed by Instagram, is the most popular social media platform. We will be publish the concert on YouTube, alongside sneak peeks and other updates on Instagram.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We will use this data to ensure our concert appeals to as much of our target demographic as possible.</p>

								<p>School closures have come into effect once again, so we’ve decided to hold another meeting to discuss the progress we’ve made so far and how we can mitigate the challenges that lockdown poses.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The majority of the promotional tasks discussed at our previous meeting have been completed. We still need to work on a radio advert, but the Instagram account sits at 76 followers and we will continue to post more behind-the-scenes content from home.</li>
									<li>We already have the equipment necessary to continue practising. This means we can keep on sending each other our work and we will try our best to document all practice.</li>
									<li>The deadline has been shifted to the end of the school year in July. We may not need to utilise much of the extra time, but it is appreciated as the lockdown will set us back a bit.</li>

								<p>We got the opportunity to come into school and practice in person today. It was great to see Conrad and Owen in person after schools have been shut again for a couple of months, and I think we got a lot from the session. Our work was solely focused on the performance aspect of our virtual concert.</p>
								<p>The main benefit from being able to play music together in person was getting the chance to piece together the separate parts we had each been practising. Trying to play in time with each other over video calls doesn’t work due to delays on all ends, syncing separate audio clips in post each time we go to practice together would be impractical. We were able to get some songs sounding really good; the informal audio recordings don’t do it justice.</p>
								<p>We were also able to share how we were getting on with our solo performances. For example, Owen’s performance of Song 2 by Blur is sounding great, and we’re near to the stage where we can properly record it. Speaking of Song 2, I’ve found some of the stems for the song, which is good because we can overlay the original guitar track (none of us really play guitar that well, if at all). Even when we were playing by ourselves, it was useful to have the others around to offer feedback.</p>
								<p>We’ll continue to practice our parts and hopefully we’ll be able to play together more often once schools eventually re-open.</p>

								<p>These weeks we were recording our performances that we have been working on. I was the de facto "audio engineer" for the sessions, and brought in my microphone and laptop to record both drums and piano. We utilised session 3 on these days and carried on afterschool just playing our pieces that we had worked on and getting them into an audio format for editing.</p>
								<p>After a bit of experimenting, I preferred the stereo pickup pattern for recording the drums and piano. As opposed to using the cardoid pickup pattern, which is more convential when utilising only a single microphone, I opted for stereo as it creates, in my opinion, more immesion. As the origin of sounds in terms of location are more emphasised with the stereo pickup pattern, it brings the listner into the recording area and in front of the drums and piano.</p>
								<p>I recorded the raw audio directly into Audacity, and made use of Adobe's Audition software for audio refinements and amplification. A large part of this process was noise reduction - generating a background noise profile and then applying that to eliminate the background sounds that are picked up by microphones. Although not always applicable to recording instruments, I like to run most audio through the ENCN process - equalise, normalise, compress, normalise. Compression is more useful for speech, so podcasts and such, so, obviously, I adapted these processes.</p>
								<p>These were straight forward sessions, but just so time consuming as we'd run through entire pieces multiple times to achieve the sound we wanted for each song.</p>

								<p>This was very similar to last week's recording session, and we finished up recording the extras and everything we didn't manage the previous week.</p>
								<p>We, however, placed a larger focus on recording video clips this time that we can include in editing. We just used our phones to film these, as the scale of the production does not neccessitate any filming equipment more advanced than that. The audio in these clips can be used to sync them up with the higher-quality audio that we've focused on the last couple of weeks. Then the phone video audio would be muted in editing in favour for the higher-quality audio.</p>

								<p>I've come across this incredibly useful open-source tool that will help us with editing "25 Years of Rock & Indie". It is called 'Spleeter' and is developed mainly by Deezer's in-house research team.</p>
								<p>Spleeter is a source separation library, providing pre-trained models for various separation modes. Simply put, the library can be harnessed to split up the various layers that make up a song. It is designed to separate vocals, drums, bass, piano, and other instruments into separate audio files that can be mixed to your liking.</p>
								<p>This is quite common for those that cover songs with their own vocals, as they can put the original song through Spleeter and reconstruct it without the original vocals layer. This results in a karaoke/instrumental track, and then you can put your own vocals over the top of the original song. This is useful because not many artists publicly share instrumental versions of their music with lyrics.</p>
								<p>We'll be using this for a slightly different case, however. We'll be keeping the original vocal layer, but removing the piano and/or drum layers from certain songs, where we have recorded our own performances of them. Let's use 'Fake Tales of San Francisco', which will be performed by Owen on the drums. We'll keep all the other layers, but with Spleeter we'll be able to easily remove the drum layer and replace it with our own recording.</p>

								<p>We have decided to heavily adjust our release programme for "25 Years of Rock & Indie" - as opposed to producing and publishing a full-length concert in one go to YouTube, we will split up each performance into an individual video. This is comparable to how TV show's split the programme into separate episodes, and group them by series. We want to have a first series released with at least 3 performances and will have that published by the end of the month.</p>
								<p>The nominated songs for the first release are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Fake Tales of San Francisco</li>
									<li>Pumped Up Kicks</li>
									<li>Song 2</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Doing this guarantees an initial release, and allows us to easily publish more performances when we wish to, most likely in the following academic year. This could also prove to be a good link between units, and if any of us also participate in the performance unit for our BTEC, then, if the performances are related to rock/indie, etc. then they can too be published on YouTube.</p>
								<p>It also cuts down on the necessary work massively, but not on the quality of the work produced. Opting for this release programme is highly beneficial and keeps various pathways open for future work and contributions on the project, beyond the BTEC.</p>

								<p>Editing the individual videos is relatively straight-forward, and much less resource-intensive when compared to producing a full-length concert in one timeline. It consists of collecting and organising all the required assets, and for some songs this also includes video clips from the official music video (used in accordance to the fair use exception of copyright laws). We already have everything we need, such as all the video clips recorded in person and at home, our audio recordings, and the original song - and by ensuring these are intuitively organised and laid out can hasten the workflow considerably. Once all assets and this organisation has been accounted for, it is a matter of laying it out as desired in the NLE.</p>
								<p>I am editing the videos with Adobe Premiere Pro, and will use Adobe Media Encoder to nicely queue up all the videos for export with the same settings once I finish all of them. The export will be in .mp4 format, H.264 encoding. This is widely supported by the vast majority of devices, but most importantly, is the standard for YouTube.</p>

								<p>Today we published our first three entries in the "25 Years of Rock & Indie" series, concluding the first round of production and publishing for our project. We intend to continue sharing music online in the coming school year now and then for fun, and this release programme easily accommodates for this. We have plenty of PPEs coming up so we'd rather focus on them right now.</p>

								<p>Objectively, the concert was relatively successful in various regards. I feel as though I have made a considerable contribution to the project, and we collaborated well to produce and present a finished product. There are a number of potential improvements that I have identified, along with numerous successes - both will be detailed as follows.</p>
								<p>When we received the briefing in September 2020, Owen, Conrad, and I decided to work together on this project. We were already on good terms, making it easier to express our creativity and collaborate. </p>
								<h3>Project Selection</h3>
								<p>We opted for creating a virtual concert. This proved to be a good balance that made equal use of all of our skills. While a podcast would have appealed more to me, it would likely have reduced the contributions that Conrad and Owen would have been able to make as there are less performance opportunities. With a virtual concert, I would be able to take responsibility for video editing and production, with both Conrad and Owen being our prime performers.</p>
								<h3>Roles & Leadership</h3>
								<p>We delegated roles based on our individual strengths. I was in charge of technical elements, such as video editing and audio recording. I feel as though I was able to make a significant contribution to the project in this area, as I am much more confident with the technicalities as opposed to being the one performing. </p>
								<p>Furthermore, I took on an extra level of leadership and served as the project manager for much of the process. I scheduled and set up meetings and official communication, as well as documenting it by recording videos and creating a minutes document for every meeting. I could then refer back to these documents and both formal and informal communication to guide the project and advance it into its next steps.</p>
								<p>Conrad and Owen are both performers and practice their instruments much more than I do and play at a much better level. We decided that they would contribute the most with the performance elements. </p>
								<p>This was a good decision, as it allowed us to focus on our separate areas and roles. However, it was a rigid setup and meant that we often did not help out with each other’s tasks or at least have much understanding about the progress being made in those areas. Next time, I think that we should either communicate more about the progress being made in each area or offer each other more opportunities to contribute to each section.</p>
								<h3>Communication & Teamwork</h3>
								<p>Over the course of the project, we communicated formally with meetings on Google Meet, and informally by messaging each other. I think there was a good balance between official and informal communication. </p>
								<p>When we needed to address project progress and next steps, we set up meetings with minutes logged and a video recorded. This helped us to create an official record of what was discussed and in which meeting, along with the proposed next steps so we can see how effectively they were acted upon.</p>
								<p>However, I feel as though we could have organised more meetings. When we did conduct meetings, they were very productive, but I don’t think there was enough formal communication, with us talking informally. This informal discussion is a lot harder to evaluate and document. I think we could improve this for next time by setting out regular intervals for meetings, regardless of the progress that has been made. For example, every 2-4 weeks would have been optimal. </p>
								<p>Teamwork was fairly straight forward - we are good friends and have been for a while, so the collaboration was natural and we could rely on each other to contribute to the project. There's little else to add, as we never had any massive disagreements throughout the life of the project, and were unanimous in most decisions. This made the project a lot less stressful to work on, I believe.</p>
								<h3>Time Management & Release</h3>
								<p>I set out to account for time management by creating a project timeline in the form of a gantt chart. These charts are commonplace in many industries for laying down tasks and their progression. I was able to make a significant contribution here in doing so, and I was able to use this document to aid my leadership of the project and guide our group's next steps.</p>
								<p>As the year unfolded, however, time management was a struggle due to the various additional commitments that each of us had outside of the project. COVID-19 and lockdown was a large contributor to these issues, as new protocols and restrictions within school prevented us from practicing during lunchtimes, which we could have done in previous years. Lockdown made it more difficult to practice our performances, and emphasised a more individual approach to project progress that impacted teamwork.</p>
								<p>We were clearly too ambitious when beginning the project, and did not accurately account for the delays we'd encounter. That said, there's not much that could be done in terms of what was beyond our control. We, however, have learnt how to better mitigate these delays this year, and we have grown our personal skills in this area.</p>
								<p>As for the release, I think our switch to uploading performances as individual videos in a series was beneficial. This positively impacted the project, as it allowed us to spend more time on each release, while keeping our opportunities open for the future. There are also potential links to other units within the music BTEC, which means we'll still be able to contribute to 'The Indie Bois' later on down the line. I'm pleased that we came to this decision, as I enjoyed getting to share our performances on the Internet as part of the course, and we'll be able to continue this.</p>
								<p>We could have improved this switch by holding an official meeting or documenting a formal discussion. This change was only determined verbally in-person and in direct messages to one another, which makes this harder to evidence. A meeting would let us discuss all the implications of such a large change at once, rather than having many casual conversations strung over multiple days.</p>
								<h3>Ideas & Planning</h3>

								<h3>Recording & Editing</h3>
								<p>This is where my primary role focusing on production and the technicalities was most prominent. I personally believe I made a considerable contribution here, bringing in my own equipment to record audio and taking the time to edit the individual performances.</p>
								<p>Recording performances and editing them together is what I found most enjoyable, fulfilling, and rewarding. I have a large amount of experience with this side of production outside of music, so this was naturally what I put myself forward for. As mentioned already, I do have my own equipment which I was able to utilise and boost the production quality of "25 Years of Rock & Indie". This massively benefitted the outcome of our project, with our only improvement maybe being to get recording audio and video earlier, but this wasn't entirely possible due to lockdown at the start of the year.</p>
